For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful,  cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Thou we are copying Salesforce, let all the css be built in react. 

Makes sure everything we build will be templatized and re-used as a components similar to salesforce lighting Design 2 library https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/2e1ef8501/p/755aff-components and sub items.
